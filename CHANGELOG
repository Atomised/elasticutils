==========================
What's new in ElasticUtils
==========================


Version 0.4: Released xxx
=========================

**API-breaking changes:**

* **ElasticUtils no longer requires Django.** If you're using Django,
  you should change your import statements from things like::

      from elasticutils import get_es, S, F

  to::

      from elasticutils.contrib.django import get_es, S, F

  Further, Django helper modules like ``cron``, ``tasks``, and
  ``models`` were all moved to ``elasticutils.contrib.django``.

  We moved `ESTestCase` from ``elasticutils.tests`` to
  ``elasticutils.contrib.django.estestcase``

  If you don't use Django, ElasticUtils is easier to use!

* If you're not using Django, `S` no longer requires a type. If you
  don't specify a type, then ElasticUtils will return results as
  dicts.

* ``values()`` was renamed to ``values_list()``.


**Changes:**

* Overhauled and cleaned up ElasticUtils tests. Running tests can be done
  with::

      DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=es_settings nosetests

* Default timeout was changed from 1 second to 5 seconds.

* Added ``es`` transform: it allows you to specify the settings with which
  to create an ES when the search is executed.

* Added ``es_builder`` transform: it allows you to specify a function
  that builds an ES which will be executed to create an ES when the
  search is executed.

* Added ``indexes`` transform: it allows you to specify the indexes to
  use for the search.

* Added ``doctypes`` transform: it allows you to specify the doctypes
  to use for the search.

* Removed requirement for nuggets.

* Continued to improve documentation.


Version 0.3: Released June 1st, 2012
====================================

**Changes:**

* Add documentation for debugging, project details and other things.

* Minor project cleanup to make it easier to maintain and use

* Make ``get_es()`` more useful. It now takes overrides that allow you to
  configure multiple kinds of ES objects for different purposes.
